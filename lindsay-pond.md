My name is **Lindsay Pond**, and this is my personal blog.  

I am currently studying software engineering at [Hack Reactor](http://www.hackreactor.com/) through their **Remote Beta Program**. I also studied at the [University of Southern California](http://www.usc.edu/), where I earned a BA in Communication and a Master of Communication Management through the Annenberg Program for Online Communities. 

Communication to software engineering probably seems like a big leap to some. It has been. And making this switch didn't happen over night. (I've spent over 7 years working in marketing and project management.) I'm making this change because across all my experiences, the parts I've enjoyed most involved building stuff. 

*Beautiful, practical, meaningful stuff.*

As a project manager, I helped others build stuff, and in marketing, I promoted that stuff. But honestly, I always wanted to be closer to the action. In 2015, it was time to make a choice: continue to watch others be creative...or jump off the deep end and learn to create things myself.

So here I am now: I make what I love.

*I love what I do.*
